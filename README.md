## Welcome to bestia.dev!

Visit my web page: [bestia.dev](https://bestia.dev)

I worked for 30 years on commercial projects. It was hard, but fun. I am on a long vacation now and I have time to learn a new programming language. I want to share my learning path with beginners.

Read some descriptions of "dev" in urbandictionary.com :-DDD

## Tutorials

Most of my work is more like a tutorial then a finished product:  [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).  
Have fun and enjoy learning what I learn. I try to make it easy as possible.  
Rust, Wasm/Webassembly, Progressive Web App, web servers, CLI (command line interface), library/crates, docker containers, ...  

## youtube video tutorial

In my video tutorial series "bestia-dev Tutorials for Rust programming language" I explain how I use my development environment. You can see steps and processes that are not explained in README files.

## Project groups aka GitHub Organizations

Sometimes a single repository is not enought to contain a Project.  
To group repositories together GitHub invented Organizations. I have 2 of these:

- [CRUSTDE-ContainerizedRustDevEnv](https://github.com/CRUSTDE-ContainerizedRustDevEnv/CRUSTDE_Containerized_Rust_DevEnv)
- [automation-tasks-rs](https://github.com/automation-tasks-rs)

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
